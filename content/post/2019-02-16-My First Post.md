The most amazing thing about this world is that it is full of unpredictability.  Just as forrest gump said “My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.” , you never know where you will go and how high you will achieve until you take action and do it.

Hope, hope is the most valuable diamond owned by human beings. Just believe, believe all ambitions will finally be realised, and burn your energy to acheive this goal. Success will be with us, and time will witness this glorious procedure.
